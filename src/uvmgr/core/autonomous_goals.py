"""
Autonomous Goal Generation System
=================================

This module implements autonomous goal setting and pursuit for AGI capability.
The system can analyze its environment, identify improvement opportunities,
and autonomously set and pursue goals without human intervention.

Key Features:
- Environmental analysis and opportunity detection
- Autonomous goal generation based on system state
- Goal prioritization and planning
- Autonomous execution using existing uvmgr commands
- Progress tracking and adaptation

This fills a critical AGI gap: reactive-only behavior vs proactive goal pursuit.
