## 📊 Feature Coverage Analysis

### Telemetry Gaps (Critical)
- **0% telemetry coverage** across all command groups
- Need to fix instrumentation decorators
- Span tracking not working properly

### Command Group Completion
```
High Coverage (70-90%):
- deps: 90% ✓
- claude: 80% ✓ 
- spiff-otel: 80% ✓
- build: 80% ✓
- otel: 70% ✓
- agent: 70% ✓

Medium Coverage (30-60%):
- project: 60%
- forge: 50%
- serve: 40%
- workflow: 30%

Low Coverage (0-20%):
- remote: 20%
- All others: 0%
```

### Week 4+: Enterprise & Security
6. **Clean-Room Engine** (5-7 days)
   - Isolation implementation
   - Resource management
   - Security hardening

## 💡 80/20 Principles Applied

### Focus Areas (20% effort, 80% value)
1. **Telemetry fixes** - Without this, we can't validate anything
2. **Guide Catalog** - Core value proposition for agents
3. **Domain-Pack** - Enables entire ecosystem

### Defer (80% effort, 20% value)
1. Enterprise features (RBAC, SSO) - Not critical for MVP
2. Level-0 Reactive AGI - Future capability
3. Complex GitOps features - Can use simple version first

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
- Telemetry coverage > 80%
- Guide catalog functional
- Domain packs loading

### Medium Term (3-4 weeks)
- External project integration working
- PR automation functional
- Span generation automated

### Long Term (1-2 months)
- Clean-room isolation complete
- Enterprise features added
- AGI foundations in place

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

1. **Debug telemetry** - Why is OTEL status showing 0%?
2. **Implement guide catalog** - Start with basic fetching
3. **Create domain pack loader** - Enable template ecosystem

The 80/20 principle says: Fix telemetry first (foundation), then guide catalog (value), then domain packs (ecosystem).
