# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Telemetry-First Design

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Modern distributed systems require comprehensive observability. Traditional logging approaches are insufficient for understanding complex workflows.

### Decision
Implement OpenTelemetry as the core telemetry framework with:
- Automatic span creation for all operations
- Semantic conventions for standardized attributes
- No-op implementations when telemetry is disabled
- Zero performance overhead in production

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Enterprise-ready observability, vendor-neutral instrumentation
- **Negative**: Additional complexity in implementation, learning curve for developers
- **Trade-off**: We accept complexity in exchange for operational excellence

## ADR-002: Three-Layer Architecture

### Status
Accepted

### Context
CLI applications often mix concerns, making testing and maintenance difficult. We need clear separation between user interface, business logic, and I/O operations.

### Decision
Implement strict three-layer architecture:
1. **Commands**: CLI interface using Typer
2. **Operations**: Pure business logic functions
3. **Runtime**: All I/O operations (subprocess, file system)

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Testability, maintainability, clear boundaries
- **Negative**: More boilerplate, potential over-engineering for simple commands
- **Trade-off**: Additional structure justified by long-term maintainability

## ADR-003: AI Integration Strategy

### Status
Accepted

### Context
AI capabilities are becoming essential for developer tools, but we cannot depend on external AI services being available.

### Decision
Implement graceful degradation with multiple fallback levels:
1. Primary: DSPy with configured LLM
2. Secondary: Local models via Ollama
3. Fallback: Template-based generation
4. Final: Basic string operations

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Works in air-gapped environments, no vendor lock-in
- **Negative**: Complex fallback logic, multiple code paths to maintain
- **Trade-off**: Complexity acceptable for reliability

---

## ADR-004: Semantic Conventions

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Telemetry data is only valuable if it's consistently structured and discoverable across systems.

### Decision
Generate semantic conventions from YAML specifications using Weaver:
- All attributes follow OpenTelemetry naming conventions
- Type-safe access through generated Python classes
- Validation at runtime to ensure compliance

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Interoperability with observability platforms, type safety
- **Negative**: Additional build step, learning curve for conventions
- **Trade-off**: Standardization worth the overhead

---

## ADR-005: Plugin Architecture

### Status
Proposed

### Context
The core platform cannot anticipate all use cases. We need an extension mechanism that maintains system integrity.

### Decision
Implement domain pack loader with:
- Namespace isolation for plugins
- Capability-based security model
- Semantic versioning for compatibility
- Marketplace for discovery

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Ecosystem growth, community contributions
- **Negative**: Security concerns, quality control challenges
- **Trade-off**: Growth potential outweighs risks with proper governance

## ADR-006: Performance Budget

### Status
Accepted

### Context
CLI tools must feel instantaneous. Users abandon slow tools regardless of functionality.

### Decision
Establish performance budgets:
- Command startup: <100ms
- Simple operations: <200ms
- Complex operations: <1s
- Background tasks: Async with progress indication

### Implementation
- Lazy imports for all modules
- Subprocess pooling for repeated operations
- Caching for expensive computations
- Progress bars for long operations

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Excellent user experience, competitive advantage
- **Negative**: Complexity in optimization, ongoing performance monitoring
- **Trade-off**: Performance is non-negotiable for developer tools

## ADR-007: Error Handling Philosophy

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Developer tools must provide actionable error messages while maintaining security.

### Decision
Implement structured error handling:
- User-friendly messages with suggested fixes
- Detailed debug information with --debug flag
- Structured logging for automation
- Never expose sensitive information

### Example
```
❌ Failed to add dependency 'requests'
   
   The package index appears to be unreachable.
   
   Try:
   • Check your internet connection
   • Verify proxy settings with: uvmgr config show
   • Use --index-url to specify an alternative index
   
   For more details, run with --debug
```

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Better developer experience, reduced support burden
- **Negative**: More complex error handling code
- **Trade-off**: Investment in UX pays dividends in adoption

## ADR-008: Distribution Strategy

### Status
Under Review

### Context
Python packaging is complex. Users want single-file executables without Python dependencies.

### Decision
Multi-channel distribution:
1. **PyPI**: Traditional pip install for Python users
2. **Homebrew**: Native packaging for macOS
3. **Binary**: PyOxidizer for standalone executables
4. **Container**: Official Docker images
5. **Cloud**: One-click deployments for major platforms

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Maximum reach, user choice
- **Negative**: Complex release process, multiple artifacts to maintain
- **Trade-off**: Accessibility drives adoption

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Fail Fast, Recover Gracefully**
Detect errors early but always provide a path forward.

### 2. **Convention Over Configuration**
Sensible defaults with escape hatches for power users.

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
Simple tasks simple, complex tasks possible.

### 4. **Observability Over Debugging**
Build systems that explain themselves.

### 5. **Ecosystem Thinking**
Design for extension and integration from day one.
