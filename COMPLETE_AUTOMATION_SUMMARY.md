### 2. **The Weaver Forge Exoskeleton Pattern**

```python
# The Revolutionary Concept:
class WeaverForgeExoskeleton:
    """
    An external automation system that wraps around projects,
    providing superhuman capabilities while maintaining project integrity.
    
    Like an exoskeleton augments biological capabilities,
    this system augments software development capabilities.
    """
