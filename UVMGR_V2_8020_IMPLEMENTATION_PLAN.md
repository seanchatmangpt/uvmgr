# uvmgr v2: 80/20 Implementation Plan

## üéØ Executive Summary

This document determines what components from uvmgr v1 should be **preserved** for v2 and what should be **implemented using the 80/20 principle** to maximize value with minimal effort. Based on comprehensive analysis of the current codebase, architecture decisions, and gap analysis.

## üìä Current State Analysis

### **Command Inventory Summary**
- **Total Commands**: 40+ command groups
- **Enabled Commands**: 15 (37.5%)
- **Disabled Commands**: 25+ (62.5%)
- **Three-Tier Architecture Compliance**: ~30%
- **Test Coverage**: ~32%
- **Telemetry Coverage**: 100% (achieved)

### **Critical Findings**
1. **Architecture Violations**: 70% of commands bypass ops layer
2. **Missing Runtime**: 70% of commands lack runtime implementations
3. **Test Gaps**: 67.5% of commands have no test coverage
4. **Disabled Features**: 62.5% of commands are disabled due to import issues

## üèóÔ∏è What MUST Stay for v2 (Core Foundation)

### **1. Core Architecture Components**

#### **‚úÖ Preserve: Three-Layer Architecture**
```Commands ‚Üí Operations ‚Üí Runtime
```
- **Rationale**: ADR-002 mandates this architecture
- **Value**: Testability, maintainability, clear boundaries
- **Implementation**: Keep existing structure, fix violations

#### **‚úÖ Preserve: OpenTelemetry Integration**
- **Rationale**: ADR-001 mandates telemetry-first design
- **Value**: Enterprise observability, vendor-neutral instrumentation
- **Implementation**: Keep current telemetry framework (100% coverage achieved)

#### **‚úÖ Preserve: Semantic Conventions**
- **Rationale**: ADR-004 mandates Weaver-generated conventions
- **Value**: Interoperability, type safety, standardization
- **Implementation**: Keep current semconv framework

### **2. Core Commands (Essential Functionality)**

#### **‚úÖ Preserve: Package Management**
```yaml
deps:
  commands: ["add", "remove", "upgrade", "list", "lock"]
  status: "Working (90% coverage)"
  value: "Core package management functionality"
  effort: "Low - just fix architecture violations"
```

#### **‚úÖ Preserve: Testing Framework**
```yaml
tests:
  commands: ["run", "coverage", "discover", "generate"]
  status: "Working (80% coverage)"
  value: "Essential for quality assurance"
  effort: "Medium - fix architecture violations"
```

#### **‚úÖ Preserve: Build System**
```yaml
build:
  commands: ["build", "clean", "dist", "exe"]
  status: "Working (80% coverage)"
  value: "Package building and distribution"
  effort: "Low - minor fixes needed"
```

#### **‚úÖ Preserve: Code Quality**
```yaml
lint:
  commands: ["check", "fix", "format"]
  status: "Working (0% coverage - needs architecture fix)"
  value: "Essential for code quality"
  effort: "Medium - fix architecture violations"
```

#### **‚úÖ Preserve: OpenTelemetry Management**
```yaml
otel:
  commands: ["status", "coverage", "weaver", "registry"]
  status: "Working (70% coverage)"
  value: "Core observability functionality"
  effort: "Low - enhance with Weaver abstraction"
```

### **3. Core Infrastructure**

#### **‚úÖ Preserve: Core Modules**
- `uvmgr.core.telemetry` - Telemetry framework
- `uvmgr.core.instrumentation` - Command instrumentation
- `uvmgr.core.semconv` - Semantic conventions
- `uvmgr.core.process` - Process execution utilities
- `uvmgr.core.shell` - Shell utilities

#### **‚úÖ Preserve: Runtime Utilities**
- `uvmgr.runtime.security` - Security scanning
- `uvmgr.runtime.worktree` - Git worktree management
- `uvmgr.runtime.uv` - UV package manager integration

## üö´ What Should NOT Stay for v2 (Remove/Replace)

## üéØ Conclusion

The 80/20 principle applied to uvmgr v2 means:

1. **Keep the core foundation** (architecture, telemetry, semantic conventions)
2. **Fix architecture violations** (low effort, high value)
3. **Enable working commands** (very low effort, high value)
4. **Complete Weaver integration** (medium effort, high value)
5. **Defer experimental features** (high effort, low value)

This approach will deliver **80% of the value with 20% of the effort**, creating a solid, maintainable, and feature-rich uvmgr v2 that follows all architectural principles while maximizing user value.
