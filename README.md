**`uvmgr`** is a unified Python workflow engine powered by `uv`. It provides a single, consistent command-line interface to streamline the entire development lifecycleâ€”from project creation to release.

### Key Features

*   **Project Scaffolding:** Create modern Python projects from templates.
*   **Dependency Management:** A simple, powerful wrapper around `uv` for managing packages.
*   **Testing & Coverage:** Run your test suite with `pytest` and generate coverage reports.
*   **Builds & Releases:** Build packages and manage versions with Commitizen.
*   **AI-Assisted Development:** Leverage language models to review code, generate plans, and fix tests.
*   **Environment Interaction:** Execute scripts and tools directly within the project's virtual environment.
*   **Workflow Automation:** Run BPMN workflows or schedule recurring tasks.

### Installation

```bash
pip install uvmgr
```

### Getting Started: A Quick Tour

Experience the unified workflow in just a few commands:

1.  **Create a new project with a FastAPI skeleton:**
    ```bash
    uvmgr new my-awesome-project --fastapi
    ```

2.  **Navigate into your new project:**
    ```bash
    cd my-awesome-project
    ```

3.  **Add a new dependency:** `uv` will automatically find and update your `pyproject.toml`.
    ```bash
    uvmgr deps add "requests"
    ```

4.  **Run the test suite:**
    ```bash
    uvmgr tests run
    ```

5.  **Build your package:**
    ```bash
    uvmgr build dist
    ```
