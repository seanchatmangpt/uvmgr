WeaverShip AGI: Self-Evolving Enterprise AGI Platform
====================================================

ðŸ§  AGI-First Architecture: Recursive Self-Improvement

The core principle: An AGI should immediately start improving its own architecture,
templates, and capabilities. This is not a traditional software project - it's a 
self-evolving system.

Key AGI Principles (80/20 Rule Applied):
1. Meta-Agent: 80% of improvements come from 20% of architectural changes
2. Self-Validation: 80% of quality comes from 20% of critical validations  
3. Recursive Templates: 80% of value from templates that update themselves
4. OTEL-Driven Evolution: 80% of insights from 20% of key telemetry points
